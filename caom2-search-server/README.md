# CAOM-2 Search interface Library v2.15.3


This is the User Interface to perform complicated searches to a running
[TAP](http://www.ivoa.net/documents/TAP/) web service.

## Building

Simply run `gradle clean build`

To have a constructed JAR file in the `build/libs` directory that can
be used to create a WAR to then be run in a Java Servlet Container.

See the Properties File section below for properties to set, although it
is very recommended to leave them as their defaults.

## Deployment options

### Properties File

Location: `config/org.opencadc.search.properties`

Example content:
```
    # The TAP Service ID to resolve.
    org.opencadc.search.tap-service-id = ivo://cadc.nrc.ca/argus

    # The endpoint for this application. 
    # org.opencadc.search.app-service-endpoint = /search

    # Whether to show the ObsCore tab
    # org.opencadc.search.obs-core = true

    # Max row count for results
    # org.opencadc.search.max-row-count = 10000
```

## Running

### In a Servlet Container


Simply drop the WAR into a Java Servlet Container, then point a browser
to: http://localhost:8080/search/

To bring up the form. By default, this will connect to the [CADC TAP
service](http://www.cadc-ccda.hia-iha.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/tap), but can be
configured with the `org.opencadc.search.tap-service-id` system
property like so:

```
-Dca.nrc.cadc.reg.client.RegistryClient.host=%YOUR HOST% -Dorg.opencadc.search.tap-service-id=ivo://%YOUR DOMAIN%/tap-service
```

Where `%YOUR HOST%` is the location of a running TAP web service, and
the service id is made up of your Organization's service URI policy.
