SEARCH_HELP_HTML = <p> \
                     Advanced Search is a unified portal to all the data collections stored at \
                     CADC. Queries can be constrained by a wide variety of metadata including \
                     observation details, position, time and energy. \
                   </p> \
                   <p> \
                     The CADC contains millions of observations. To ensure that your computer is \
                     not overwhelmed we limit the size of interactive queries to 30,000 rows. \
                     Selecting multiple constraints on the search page will improve the chances \
                     that the data you are looking for appears in your search result.  One can \
                     further refine the query on the results page using filtering, sorting and \
                     previews, so more liberal initial queries can be used so long as they do \
                     not exceed the 30,000 row limit (note that for downloading the results as a \
                     file there is no limit). \
                   </p> \
                   <p> \
                     Tooltips that appear when you hover over the constraint boxes give \
                     clickable search examples and show the possible units in which to enter \
                     numerical quantities. \

                      Search results appear in a table on this page. A maximum of 30,000 rows are \
                      contained in this table. By default the displayed table contains all these \
                      rows and can be scrolled through quickly. If preferred, the table can be \
                      split into multiple pages using the controls under the table. \
                    </p> \
                    <p> \
                      The full tabular results of the query can be downloaded by clicking on the \

                    </p> \
                    <p> \
                      Columns in the results table may be sorted by clicking on the column header \
                      cell and filtered by entering filter value(s) in the box below each column \
                      heading.  The units of some numerical fields can be controlled by selectors \
                      under the filtering boxes. The &quot;Manage Column Display&quot; link above \
                      the results table displays a popup box that shows all available metadata \
                      columns and allows user control of column selection and ordering. \

                      The leftmost column contains tick boxes to mark datasets for download. \
